# Terraform "Hello, World" Example

This folder contains the simplest possible Terraform module—one that just outputs "Hello, World"—to demonstrate how you
can use Terratest to write automated tests for your Terraform code.

Check out [test/terraform_hello_world_example_test.go](/test/terraform_hello_world_example_test.go) to see how you can
write automated tests for this simple module.

Note that this module doesn't do anything useful; it's just here to demonstrate the simplest usage pattern for
Terratest. For a slightly more complicated example of a Terraform module and the corresponding tests, see
[terraform-basic-example](/examples/terraform-basic-example).
